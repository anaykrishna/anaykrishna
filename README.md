# ExPOS - MyExpos OS Project

ExPOS (Exponential Operating System) is a personal project that I am working on as part of my semester project to create an operating system called **MyExpos OS**. This is an open-source project aimed at understanding and implementing core operating system concepts such as process management, memory management, file systems, and system calls.

The repository contains the codebase for the kernel, basic system utilities, and the architecture behind MyExpos OS.

## Key Features
- Basic kernel development (process scheduling, interrupts, system calls)
- Memory management (paging and segmentation)
- Simple file system for file and directory management
- Device drivers for hardware interaction

This project serves as an educational tool and a practical implementation of OS principles.
